- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
assocating the Sacrecrow class with the many pieces of the scarecrow's body allowed me to fix bugs in each class more easily. I did miss seeing the entire scarecrow as i created it all at once and it was a little annoying to line the parts up, but I appreciated the segmentation otherwise.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 My biggest roadblock came wit the banner, in python I would just multiply a string to get it to show up many times but in java I had to use a for loop, which was more work and was also not obvious to me at first. i would advise someone taking this course to try to use simple loops or oother techniques we have already learned first before trying complicated methods from the internet.
